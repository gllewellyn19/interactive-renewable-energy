startingMessageAnimationhydro=Welcome to an animation of how hydro energy works
waterFlows=Water flows into the hydroelectric dam.
waterSpinsTurbine=The flowing water turns a turbine in\nthe hydroelectric dam.
turbineSpins=The spinning of the turbine causes a metal\nshaft in an electric generator to spin.\nThis is the rotor spinning inside of the stator.
rotorSpins=The spinning of the rotor causes the\nfield poles/ electromagnets to move past the\nconductors on the stator.
electricityCreated=Electromagnets passing the conductors\non the stator creates a flow of\nelectricity which is stored in various manners
windFlows=Wind flows into the wind farm.
windSpinsTurbine=The wind turns the turbine in\nof a windmill.
endAnimationMessage=Thanks for watching this animation!
